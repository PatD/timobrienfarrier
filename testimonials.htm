<em>I am pleased to be able to write this testimonial for Tim O'Brien, Farrier.  
I know Tim to be a well-educated and well-practiced master of his craft, 
who continually pursues professional development opportunities.
He is mature beyond his years, professional in his business relationships, 
pleasant and positive of manner, always courteous, kind and patient with owners and horses, and prompt, 
in both returning phone calls and keeping appointments.  
Tim is able to accommodate my work schedule and has gone out of his way to work independently when situations make 
it impossible for me to meet him.  He negotiates with kindness and gentle persuasion, my mare's moody temperament.
<br />
<br />
Tim accepted my horse and I as customers nearly six years ago when I first became a horse owner.  This mature mare came to me shoeless and with very little hoof.  
Through Tim's skill, patient encouragement, and corrective progressive actions, she has developed fabulous feet.  
I highly recommend Tim O'Brien.</em><br /><br />
